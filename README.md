### 📌 why do I need this?
This mod is primarily designed for modpack developers. It allows you to easily clean up the mess and clutter in the controls menu, as well as better integrate keybinds from mods into the game.

### 🔎 what about similar mods?
Most mods that affect this menu only allow you to hide keys. In this mod, functionality is expanded, and it is much easier to use. Combine keybinds, move keybinds between categories, reorder the categories, and hide anything entirely.
