### 📌 about
**Tidy Binds** is a highly configurable utility primarily designed for modpack developers. It allows you to easily clean up the mess and clutter in the controls menu, as well as better integrate keybinds from mods into the game.

### 🛠️ features

- **key combinations:** Trigger multiple actions with a single key by linking them together.
- **category management:** Move any keybind into a different category, including custom ones you define yourself.
- **category ordering:** Control exactly where each category appears in the list by assigning custom sort indices.
- **key hiding:** Hide unwanted keybinds from the Key Binds screen to reduce clutter.
- **key unbinding:** Unbind hidden keys to prevent them from conflicting with existing ones.
- **entry spacing:** Add pixel padding between list entries for a cleaner look.
- **conflict suppression:** Disable the red highlighting on actions that share the same key.
- **debug tools:** Print all available key and category names to the log, or reveal hidden keys in a special category for troubleshooting.
- **in-game configuration:** Every feature can be toggled via the config screen to fit your specific playstyle.
